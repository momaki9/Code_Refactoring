For this assignment, my task was to refactor the html and css code for a marketing agency (*Horiseon*) and make it more accessible.  

I started out by removing most of the div elements throught the html page and used semantic elements, such as nav for the main navigation bar at the top of the site.
I also used the main element to encompass the most important information within the body of the page. I used figure element for the background image, and so on.
The next improvement that I made on the html document was I replaced individual classes with a _general_ class in the case where the styling was the same for those previous sections.
For example, the 3 elements within the main section all had different classes but were all styled in the same exact way. I applied this strategy throught the html document whereever possible.
As a result, I consolidated alot of the styling code/selectors in the css style sheet as I see fit, without compromising the aesthetics of the website.
Finally, I included comments in as many areas as I possibly could to note the changes I had made to the previous code.   

Overall, this has been a challenging yet rewarding assignment. I feel like I have cracked the code when it comes to tacking assignments such as this one.
