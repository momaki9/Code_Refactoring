# Code Refactoring

## In this application, you will find a simple site that conforms to the current standards of acessibility. The code in this application was refactored to use semantic elements, such as nav for the main navigation bar at the top of the site, to especially help users with a screen reader navigate the site properly. In addition, all images include alternate text that describe the images.
